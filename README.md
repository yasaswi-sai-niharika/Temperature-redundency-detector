# Temperature-redundency-detector
IOT project for measuring the temperature redundancies and sending alerts via email and messages by using python language in Linux Operating System.

requirements are bolt/arduino board,connecting probs,RTD sensor.

after connecting these hardware and software components, the detector Reads input for every 5 minutes and checks with the threshold value. If it observe any changes in the temperature, a immediate email and message alerts will be sent to our mobile.
This project is used in most temperature sensitive areas like power plants, pharmaceutical industries etc.
